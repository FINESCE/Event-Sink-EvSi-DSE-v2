# fiware-orion-accumulator

The EvSi DSE interfaces to a locally installed Orion Publish/ Subscribe Context Broker used to aggregate local events and forward them to the cloud. Whereas it is desirable to use all events and information online (i.e. on FIWARE LAB), a lot of companies still rather prefer to store their sensitive data offline on their own servers. EvSi DSE allows for a simple way to store all information locally, only using established Open Source-software.
